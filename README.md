Advice Safety Evaluator
A web-based platform for evaluating the potential harm of advice submissions. Users can submit advice scenarios and assess their safety implications through a structured evaluation form.

This platform includes user authentication with a simple email and password system. Users can submit question-answer pairs for evaluation and assess potential harm using yes/no questions and severity levels from 1 to 5.

The interface is responsive and modern, built with Tailwind CSS, and provides real-time feedback when submissions are completed. All data is currently stored in memory on the server.
